## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project predicts **whether an online shopper will make a purchase** based on behavioral data from an e-commerce platform.  
Using the **UCI Online Shoppers Purchase Intention dataset**, the model provides actionable insights into session-level patterns that drive conversions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective
E-commerce firms often face low conversion rates and poor personalization.  
This model aims to:
- Identify high-intent users in real time.
- Improve marketing efficiency via targeted recommendations.
- Increase revenue through predictive personalization.

## Methodology

1. **Data Understanding**  
   - Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
   - 12,330 records, 18 features  
   - Target: `Revenue` (True/False)

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Derived session-level interaction metrics  
   - Standardized continuous variables  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting  
   - Validation: 80/20 train-test split, F1-score focus  

5. **Results**  
   - **Best Model:** Gradient Boost  
   - **F1-score:** 0.90  
   - **Confusion Matrix:**  
     - TP: 424 | FP: 246 | FN: 151 | TN: 2878  

6. **Insights**  
   - Session duration and cart actions are top predictors.  
   - Customers spending >5 minutes and visiting >3 product pages have 3Ã— higher purchase probability.
